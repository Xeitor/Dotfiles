# Just for zellij
# alows you to use `fzf` to navigate into a desire folder and either start or attach into a zellij session
# If you run it from inside zellij, it will open the newly selected folder in a new pane

# Demo of the original: https://youtu.be/bdumjiHabhQ?t=269

# 1. Place the script in your path
# 2. Create an alias to call this script in your shells .rc config:
#    bindkey -s ^f "zellij_sessionizer\n"
# 3. Update where you want to search:
#    I'm using `fd` to perform the search inside a specific dir, you can use that or `find`

if [[ $# -eq 1 ]]; then
	selected=$1
else
	selected=$(find ~/wispro ~/github_projects -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d | fzf)
fi

# If no directory was selected, exit the script
if [[ -z $selected ]]; then
	printf "No directory selected"
	exit 0
fi

# Get the name of the selected directory, replacing "." with "_"
session_name=$(basename "$selected" | tr . _)

# We're outside of zellij, so lets create a new session or attach to a new one.
if [[ -z $ZELLIJ ]]; then
	cd $selected

	# -c will make zellij to either create a new session or to attach into an existing one
	printf "opening zellij session"
	zellij attach $session_name -c
	exit 0

# We're inside zellij so we'll open a new pane and move into the selected directory
zellij action new-pane

# Hopefully they'll someday support specifying a directory and this won't be as laggy
# thanks to @msirringhaus for getting this from the community some time ago!
